// Returns the time required to travel along the path specified, in seconds.

// time is the sum of the length/speed-limit of each street segment, plus the
// given turn_penalty (in seconds) per turn implied by the path.  If there is
// no turn, then there is no penalty. Note that whenever the street id changes
// (e.g. going from Bloor Street West to Bloor Street East) we have a turn.

// returns an empty (size == 0) vector.  If more than one path exists, the path

// This is an "uber pool"-like function. The idea is to minimize driving travel
// time by walking to a pick-up intersection (within walking_time_limit secs)
// from start_intersection while waiting for the car to arrive.  While walking,
// you can ignore speed limits of streets and just account for given
// walking_speed [m/sec]. However, pedestrians should also wait for traffic
// lights, so turn_penalty applies to whether you are driving or walking.
// Walking in the opposite direction of one-way streets is fine. Driving is
// NOT!  The routine returns a pair of vectors of street segment ids. The first
// vector is the walking path starting at start_intersection and ending at the
// pick-up intersection. The second vector is the driving path from pick-up
// intersection to end_interserction.  Note that a start_intersection can be a
// pick-up intersection. If this happens, the first vector should be empty
// (size = 0).  If there is no driving path found, both returned vectors should
// be empty (size = 0). 
// If the end_intersection turns out to be within the walking time limit, 
// you can choose what to return, but you should not crash. If your user 
// interface can call this function for that case, the UI should handle
// whatever you return in that case.
