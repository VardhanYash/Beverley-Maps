    // They form a connected path (see m3.h)
    std::vector<int> subpath;

    // Specifies the indices from the deliveries vector of the picked up 
    // delivery items at the start_intersection (if a pick up is to be made)

// This routine takes in a vector of N deliveries (pickUp, dropOff
// intersection pairs), another vector of M intersections that
// are legal start and end points for the path (depots), a turn 
// penalty in seconds (see m3.h for details on turn penalties), 
// and the truck_capacity in pounds.
//
// The first vector 'deliveries' gives the delivery information.  Each delivery
// in this vector has pickUp and dropOff intersection ids and the weight (also
// in pounds) of the delivery item. A delivery can only be dropped-off after
// the associated item has been picked-up. 
// 
// The second vector 'depots' gives the intersection ids of courier company
// depots containing trucks; you start at any one of these depots and end at
// any one of the depots.
//
// This routine returns a vector of CourierSubpath objects that form a delivery route.
// The CourierSubpath is as defined above. The first street segment id in the
// first subpath is connected to a depot intersection, and the last street
// segment id of the last subpath also connects to a depot intersection.  The
// route must traverse all the delivery intersections in an order that allows
// all deliveries to be made with the given truck capacity. Addionally, a package
// should not be dropped off if you haven't picked it up yet.
//
// The start_intersection of each subpath in the returned vector should be 
// at least one of the following (a pick-up and/or drop-off can only happen at 
// the start_intersection of a CourierSubpath object):
//      1- A start depot.
//      2- A pick-up location (and you must specify the indices of the picked 
//                              up orders in pickup_indices)
//      3- A drop-off location. 
//
// You can assume that N is always at least one, M is always at least one
// (i.e. both input vectors are non-empty), and truck_capacity is always greater
// or equal to zero.
//
// It is legal for the same intersection to appear multiple times in the pickUp
// or dropOff list (e.g. you might have two deliveries with a pickUp
// intersection id of #50). The same intersection can also appear as both a
// pickUp location and a dropOff location.
//        
// If you have two pickUps to make at an intersection, traversing the
// intersection once is sufficient to pick up both packages, as long as the
// truck_capcity fits both of them and you properly set your pickup_indices in
// your courierSubpath.  One traversal of an intersection is sufficient to
// drop off all the (already picked up) packages that need to be dropped off at
// that intersection.
//
// Depots will never appear as pickUp or dropOff locations for deliveries.
//  
// If no valid route to make *all* the deliveries exists, this routine must
// return an empty (size == 0) vector.
