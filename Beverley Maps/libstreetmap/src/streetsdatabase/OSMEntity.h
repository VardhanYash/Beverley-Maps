/** OSMEntity is a base class for OSMNode, OSMWay, and OSMRelation that holds the OSM ID and the tags.
 * Use .id() to get the OSMID for this entity.
 * Tags are key,value pairs that provide information about that OSMEntity;
 * see the OpenStreetMap wiki for information on various key,value pairs that
 * may be set on an OSM Entity.
 * You should use the tag access methods in OSMDatabaseAPI.h to get the
 * key,value pairs on an OSM Entity instead of the lower-level implementation
 * methods in this file.
 *
 * The rest of this file defines the internals of OSMEntity,

/* To save space, tag keys and values are stored as "flyweights" that store a reference (index) into a vector
 * of strings held in the OSMDatabase. That permits encoding a key-value pair as two integers rather than saving
 * all of the bytes of the string, which has advantages when there is heavy reuse.
 *
 * On its own, the flyweight (which is really just an index) can only be assigned and compared for equality.
 *
 * It must be bound to the table that generated it to be able to produce a string by looking up.
 * Once bound, the implicit conversion operator permits accessing the bound flyweight as if it was a const std::string&.
