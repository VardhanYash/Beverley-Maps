/** Layer-1 OSM relation
 *
 * A relation is an OSM entity that also holds a set of members.
 * Each member has a role and is referred to by type (node/way/rel) and OSM ID.
 *
 * Role is stored as an integer index into a string table.
 *
 * You should use the top-level methods in OSMDatabaseAPI.h to get the
 * members and member roles of an OSM Relation instead of the lower-level implementation
 * methods in this file.
 *
 * Students don't need to read this file.
